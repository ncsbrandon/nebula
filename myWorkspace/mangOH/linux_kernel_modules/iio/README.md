IIO Kernel Module Definitions
=============================

The source for the IIO kernel modules comes from the standard Legato Linux kernel source tree.  The
source is copied into this directory so that it isn't necessary to have the full kernel source code
in order to build the mangOH SDEF.

The kernel source in this folder was copied from the tag `SWI9X15Y_07.12.01.00`
