# mangOH Makefile
#
# Requirements:
#  * Use leaf, or...
#  * Set LEGATO_ROOT environment variable to the path to a Legato working copy.
#  * Set XXXX_SYSROOT environment variables to the appropriate sysroot for the module. For example:
#    "export WP76XX_SYSROOT=/opt/swi/y22-ext-wp76xx/sysroots/armv7a-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi"
#  * If the Legato version in LEGATO_ROOT is < 18.02.0, then it will be necessary to do "export
#    LEGATO_SYSROOT=$XXXX_SYSROOT" where XXXX is the module the build is for.
#
# By default, the Legato framework will not be built before building the mangOH software.
# Set LEGATO=1 to trigger a build of the Legato framework first.
# WARNING: Do not use LEGATO=1 when using a Legato provided by leaf. This will result in the
# modification of files within ~/leaf-data which may be shared between many leaf workspaces
# and leaf profiles.
#
# To build with optional Octave(tm) support, set OCTAVE_ROOT to contain the path to directory
# containing the .app files for the Octave applications (such as cloudInterface.wp77xx.app).
# You also have the option of setting OCTAVE=0 to disable inclusion of Octave support even
# when OCTAVE_ROOT is set.
